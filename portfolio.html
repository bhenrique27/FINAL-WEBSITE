     <h1>My Portfolio</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to the portfolio section of my site — basically the place where I keep track of the work I’ve done, 
        the skills I'm building, and the projects that show who I am as a student and as a creator. Since I’m majoring 
        in Communications at UNM, a lot of what I work on connects back to messaging, storytelling, design, and how 
        people interact with content online. This page gives you a quick look into the things I’m learning and how they’re 
        helping shape what I want to do in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of the projects I’ve enjoyed the most include class assignments where I got to mix creativity with technical 
        skills — things like written pieces, digital media work, and even basic web development. Every project feels like 
        a small step toward becoming more confident in what I can do professionally. Even though this site is still pretty 
        simple, it represents proof that I’m learning new tools and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I grow in my major and gain more experience, I’ll keep adding work here. My goal is that one day this page becomes 
        a full collection of everything I’ve created — school projects, writing samples, media pieces, and real-world work too. 
        Thanks for taking the time to check it out, and feel free to come back as this page evolves.
    </p>
