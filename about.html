      <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Hey, thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet. This site is basically my “professional starter kit” — 
        the place where I’m slowly putting together everything I’m learning in school, the skills I’m building, and the things 
        I actually care about. I’m a Communications major at UNM, and one thing my classes constantly push is how important 
        it is to create a digital presence that feels real, not like a cookie-cutter template. So that’s what this site is about — 
        me showing who I am, in my own voice, while learning the technical side of web development at the same time.
    </p>

        When I’m not studying or working, I’m usually gaming, hanging out with my girlfriend, watching movies, or learning 
        something new. I like breaking things down, figuring out how they work, and then putting my own spin on them — 
        which is probably why web design has grown on me. This site is definitely a work in progress, but it represents 
        where I’m at right now and where I’m headed. As I keep learning HTML and CSS, this page will evolve with me.
    </p>
