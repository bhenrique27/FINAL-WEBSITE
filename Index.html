    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>
        Hey, thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet. This site is basically my “professional starter kit” — the place where I’m slowly putting together everything I’m learning in school, the skills I’m building, and the things I actually care about. I'm a Communications major at UNM, and one thing my classes constantly push is how important it is to create a digital presence that feels real, not like a cookie-cutter template. So that’s what this site is about — me showing who I am, in my own voice, while learning the technical side of web development at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
        You’ll find a few different pages here: an About page where I talk about my background and goals, a Portfolio page showing off some projects and work I’ve done, and a Contact page if you ever want to reach out. I’m still improving each part as I learn more, especially with HTML and CSS, but honestly, I’m proud of how it’s coming together. This class has definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone in terms of coding, but it’s also pretty cool seeing a website go from nothing to something that actually works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to click around, explore the links, and check out what I’ve created. This site will only get better over time, and this is just the beginning.
